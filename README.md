### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML Templates
- CSS Responsive Grid
- JS: Objects, functions, Arrow functions
- Custom JS client-side form validation
- Image Gallery with Slideshow
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

- Embedded the [Inter typeface](https://rsms.me/inter/)

### Requirements:

- Responsive
- Semantic markup
- Use B.E.M. flat file structure
- At least 2 breakpoints:
  - Desktop: 1280px - max width
  - Mobile: 320px - min width
- End result was to match the Figma design comp
- Impliment a 3 col CSS Grid to display the card gallery
- Render the card gallery dynamically using HTML Templates
- add 'like' and 'delete' actions for cards
- add buttons to open/close modals
- add CSS animations to display smooth transitions for modal transitions
- using forms to create cards/update profile
- Responsive with smooth transitions between all breakpoints (no scrollbars at any viewport size)
- 0 errors logged to the console

### Description:

This project is a clean profile type website page with a minimalist style to let the content have the floor. The css grid gallery allows the images to display all at once in thumbnail form or in full screen view upon tapping or selecting an image. The user is able to create, update. and delete items in their card gallery as well as update their profile info. Both of the forms have custom JS form validation [validation.js](./scripts/validation.js) and css animations for a clean and polished look &amp; feel.

#### Update Profile &amp; Gallery

##### Update Profile

Tap/click the pencil icon next to the user's name. Change the data to match your own then hit 'save'.

##### Add Custom Cards

To add a custom card you will need the name for the card and an image URL: 'https://example.com/path/to/Image.png'. Simply tap/click the [ + ] button to the far right of the user's name.

#### Delete

Tap/click on the trashcan icon in the upper-right corner of any card to remove it. In a future update, I plan to enhance the UX and UI by asking the user if they are sure they want to delete the card.

#### Like

Tap/click on the heart next to the item's name to 'like' it. Like is seen with the heart filled in with black.

I will add more as more comes in. I hope you enjoy the project as much as I did building it.

Happy coding everyone,
