## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Responsive Grid
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Figma Design Brief
- Chrome Dev Tools
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
- Embedded the [Inter typeface](https://rsms.me/inter/)

### What I learned

Within a short time, I realized I can whip out several layouts using a few lines of code. Learning how to layout a design using a grid a lot more comfortably and without any fear of breaking something. It's a great feeling.

Being able to use git and github has been a gigantic help. I had used it before but this time I got a more thorough understanding with the help of the Software Engineering Program at [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com)

My biggest and favorite lesson I will continue to thank them for is introducing me too BEM Methodologies. Life is far more easy to digest and understand with [BEM](https://getbem.com/). Cheesy as it sounds, it's very true.
