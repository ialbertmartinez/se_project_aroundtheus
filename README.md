## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML Templates
- CSS Responsive Grid
- JS: Objects, functions, Arrow functions
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Figma Design Brief
- Chrome Dev Tools
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
- Embedded the [Inter typeface](https://rsms.me/inter/)

### Requirements:

- Responsive
- Semantic markup
- Use B.E.M. flat file structure
- At least 2 breakpoints:
  - Desktop: 1280px - max width
  - Mobile: 320px - min width
- End result was to match the Figma design comp
- Impliment a 3 col CSS Grid to display the card gallery
- Render the card gallery dynamically using HTML Templates
- add 'like' and 'delete' actions for cards
- add buttons to open/close modals
- add CSS animations to display smooth transitions for modal transitions
- using forms to create cards/update profile
- Responsive with smooth transitions between all breakpoints (no scrollbars at any viewport size)
- 0 errors logged to the console

### Descriotion

This project is a seemingly simple profile page that allows a user to display items as a gallery of custom cards. The user is able to create, update. and delete items in their card gallery as well as update their profile info.

#### Add Custom Cards

In order to add new custom cards to the card gallery, simply tap/click the 'add button' to the far right of the user's name--indicated by the big '+' symbol. For users with screen readers, you will be able to find it using or hearing the aria-label: "add". Newest cards will be placed at the beginning of the gallery.

#### Update

Tap/cick the pencil icon next to the user's name tp edit their name and/or title.

#### Delete

Tap/click on the trashcan icon in the upper-right corder of any card to remove it from the gallery. No confirmation will be given. In a future update, I plan to add this feature in the form of an alert to ensure that is the action you want to take.

#### Like

Tap/click on the heart next to the item's name to 'like' it. In a future update, I plan to make this feature that will stay after you leave the page and come back to it. Currently a WIP.

I will add more as more comes in. I hope you enjoy the project as much as I did building it.

Happy coding everyone,
